# Tutorial

The utilization of features provided by DRAGen will be elucidated, with a particular emphasis on additional data sets required for specific classifications. These data sets are crucial for defining microstructural differences in the materials to be used. The potential microstructural features include banding, inclusions/pores, and substructure.

Depending on the microstructural properties inherent in the materials intended for modeling, the appropriate features offered by DRAGen should be selected. Additional parameters relevant to each feature are expounded upon in their respective sections.
